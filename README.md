**Note for Prof Sterne: Looking for feedback on how to make it more object oriented because right now I have simply divided the various notebook functionalities into different scripts, and I import those scripts in the gui.py file and use Tkinter onto it. The text file feedback was VERY useful btw**

Capstone: Generating new Guitar Tablature using Density Estimation and Music Theory.
  <br></br>
</h3>


How to run the program:

1. First run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Then run ```py gui.py``` or ```python gui.py```
3. Input guitar tablature for your favourite songs into the box and press enter
4. Add more tablatures if you wish
5. Choose the mode and key of the song
6. Get new tablatures as output!


Things left to do:

1. Make the project more object oriented
2. Fix program for various scenarios such as wrong user input, a modified text file etc.
3. Change the probability of sampling the root note of a key (it should be higher, I will set a parameter for that).
