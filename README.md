Capstone: Generating new Guitar Tablature using Density Estimation and Music Theory.
  <br></br>
</h3>


How to run the program:

1. First run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. For linux users, you may be missing out on the tkinter module so try running ```sudo apt-get install python3-tk``` in the terminal
3. Then run ```py gui.py``` or ```python gui.py```
4. Input guitar tablature for your favourite songs into the box and press enter
5. Add more tablatures if you wish
6. Choose the mode and key of the song
7. Get new tablatures as output!


Things left to do:

1. Make the project more object oriented
2. Fix program for various scenarios such as wrong user input, a modified text file etc.
3. Change the probability of sampling the root note of a key (it should be higher, I will set a parameter for that).
