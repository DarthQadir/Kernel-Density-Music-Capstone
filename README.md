  <br></br>
</h3>


How to run the program:

1. First run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. For linux users, you may be missing out on the tkinter module so try running ```sudo apt-get install python3-tk``` in the terminal
3. Then run ```py gui.py``` or ```python gui.py```
4. Input guitar tablature for your favourite songs into the box and press enter
5. Add more tablatures if you wish
6. Choose the mode and key of the song
7. Get new tablatures as output!


Things left to do:

1. Make it more likely that the root note is sampled i.e. if a user chooses F as a key then the F note should be more likely to be sampled.
